        <h3>She's learning html</h3>
        <p>She started off with watching YouTube videos, and then her friend Alex showed her his beautiful website and she got inspired! Thankfully she has a good resource to learn html and is practicing on this website right now. Next week, she will master html and move onto css.</p>

        <h6>Let's talk about Blink Fitness. I went to the gym today for the third time and for once it was not crowded at all! The first two times I went, I remember I had to adjust my workouts to whatever machines/equipment were available. It was pretty annoying, but I was most annoyed by the crowd. 
            <br>
            <br>But I think I figured out the solution. 
            <br>
           <br>First, Alex says that he would go to Blink FItness at 7:45am on weekdays and would not be able to workout at all. However, Dan and Chris says that it is not too crowded in the mornings. 
           <br> 
           <br>Who do I believe!?!?! 
           <br>
            <br>Well, today I went to the gym at 9:00am and I barely had to wait for anything, finishing my workout in my ideal time--An hour. And that's probably because typically people start work at 8-9am. While Alex probably went at a time all the professionals workout, Dan and Chris went at a time that people are usually working. 
           <br>
            <br>That is my theory and maybe I will sign up for Blink Fitness if my Theory is correct :) </h6>
